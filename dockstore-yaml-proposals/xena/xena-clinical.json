  "description": "Treehouse Public Expression Dataset v9 (March 2019).  Treehouse RNASeq gene expression data.  Values in this dataset use HUGO gene names and are transformed by log2(x +1) of the TPM value.  This data was generated by the ribodepletion library preparation method.  Note that this is a poor example; you wouldn't point to public data like this but instead private data",
