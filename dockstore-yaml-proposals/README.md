# Proposals

This contains subdirectories of evolving example and proposed .dockstore.yml files, to try to handle
concrete services that might get registered with Dockstore.

The three services are:

* Xena Hub - docker-compose for the hub is [here](https://github.com/coverbeck/xenahub)
* [Bravo](https://github.com/statgen/bravo) -- Variant browser
* generick8s -- this is a Kubernetes guest book example application. Using it until I can find a bioinformatics, K8s service.

Currently we are just actively iterating over Xena.
